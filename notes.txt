Syntax Blast TODO / Notes

- There's an issue with the text animation loop.. where
  it gets faster and faster..

- Work on UI, layout, get basic pieces in place
    - The player-input element
    - The level-area element

After getting level logic, stats, level UI loading and saving complete:
- Should probably be using a canvas, animation lib, and animation frames
- Build levels
- Add level configs
