Gameplay
End Of Level
Between Level Transition <----------      Congrats / Level Menu / Stats / Load & Run Next Level
Player Fail / Health / Try Again <------- Need health check logic / failed / game over
------
But Today: Screw with cool css.
           Screw with completely different approach / pivot, from being only
           a developer's learning/training tool to a more general actual game,
           but still aligned with the concept(s)

    TODO: 
        - Need level complete, level failed state
        - Is there ever really a GAME OVER and LIVES, or you just have to 
          complete the whole thing (with breakpoints) to win
        - Need to introduce a dynamic Pre-level. post-level, game status 
          message display utils


--- IDEAS:
        - No levels, but a continuous stream of enemies with breakpoints
        - Enemies with armor where a character must be typed more than once
            in order to break through and cause damage

        - I think the player input should be fixed near bottom of screen
        and larger... while the level area is then more prodiment





               {}
            (       )
        (               )
        ----------------


        [ { } ] : [ { } ]
        {{{{{{{{}}}}}}}}
            {{{{{}}}}}



                [   ]
            [           ]
        [                   ]
            [           ]
                [   ]




        {     {       }     }
            {   {  }    }
                {  }
                





















----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- try body background ui color switcher (only in level dev / test area level)

The whole first level is a playground / demo / customizable level
until moved to a switch that may be turned off and on
once game is further along..
