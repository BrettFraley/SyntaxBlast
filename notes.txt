Syntax Blast TODO / Notes

- Work on UI, layout, get basic pieces in place
    - The player-input element
    - The level-area element

After getting level logic, stats, level UI loading and saving complete:
- Should probably be using a canvas, animation lib, and animation frames
- Build a level

MOVING FORWARD
---------------
- Keep to one level.
- A missed challenge reduces health by -25 and that challenge is just gone
- The Player Stats
- Basic needed UI Things
- Inviting instructions
- Start button launches instructions and ready button
	- Logo shrinks down.
	- Level area appears with ready button
	- STATS: Current game attempt stats
		- Time in game stats eg: how far, how much time, attempts
FUN
- Soundtrack with Options


JULY 19th
-----------
- do something with the stats
    -- positioned them 						[ X ]
    ---- next hide until game init			[   ] 
    ---- next - make style changes			[   ]

- put padding above player input / mess with width
- try colors on level area
- FIX LOOP


- try body background ui color switcher (only in level dev / test area level)


The whole first level is a playground / demo / customizable level
until moved to a switch that may be turned off and on
once game is further along..
